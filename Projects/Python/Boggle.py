# In this homework, you will build the internals for Boggle, a popular
# word game played with 16 6-sided dice. At the same time, in class we
# will develop the interactive user interface for Boggle, so that your
# solution, augmented with what we do in class, will give you a
# playable Boggle game. This assignment will also give us a chance to
# work on a system using the object-oriented paradigm.
#
# This is version 1 of the template file, which does not include the
# user interface.  I will periodically release updated versions, which
# you can then merge into your own code: still, be sure to follow the
# instructions carefully, so as to ensure your code will work with the
# new template versions that contain the GUI we develop in class.
#
# The rules of Boggle are available online. Basically, you will roll
# the dice and arrange them into a 4x4 grid. The top faces of the die
# will display letters, and your job is to find words starting
# anywhere in the grid using only adjacent letters (where "adjacent"
# means vertically, horizontally, and diagonally adjacent). In our
# version of Boggle, there are no word length constraints beyond those
# implicitly contained in the master word list.
#
# Although other dice configurations are possible, the original Boggle
# dice are (in no particular order):
D = ["aaeegn","abbjoo","achops","affkps","aoottw","cimotu","deilrx","delrvy",
     "distty","eeghnw","eeinsu","ehrtvw","eiosst","elrtty","himnqu","hlnnrz"]

# You will need sample() from the random module to roll the die.
from random import sample, randint

# Boggle is the base class for our system; it is analogous to the
# Othello class in our implementation of that game.  It contains all
# the important data elements for the current puzzle, including:
#    Boggle.board = the current puzzle board
#    Boggle.words = the master word list
#    Boggle.solns = the words found in the current puzzle board
#    Boggle.lpfxs = the legal prefixes found in the current puzzle board
# Additional data elements are used for the GUI and scoring, which
# will be added in subsequent versions of the template file.
#
# Note: we will opt to use Knuth's 5,757 element 5-letter word list
# ('words.dat') from the Wordnet puzzle, but the 113,809 element list
# of words from HW1 ('words.txt') should also work just as easily.
